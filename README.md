# landing-page

## Personalized mock landing page

### Objectives

In this project, I am expected to create a webpage that will show my understanding of the fundamental concepts of CSS such as the cascade, CSS rules, and the box model. This will particularly demonstrate my skills in implementing a design for a mock landing page using the flexible box layout (flexbox) module.
